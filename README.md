# iphone-se-2nd-3rd-gen-case üì±
Minimalist phone case design for iPhone SE (2nd &amp; 3rd Gen). For anyone else clinging to this vintage device, I've got you covered - literally.

The design is optimized for 3D printing in PLA filament. The below was printed on a Bambulab A1 Mini using default settings.
